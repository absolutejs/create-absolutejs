## Terms

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative
works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work. The
Licensor may make an Additional Use Grant, permitting limited production use.

### Additional Use Grant

You may use the Licensed Work in production, provided your use does not include
any of the following:

1. **Offering a Competing Service.** You may not offer the Licensed Work, or
   any derivative of it, to third parties as a hosted or managed service that
   competes with the Licensed Work itself (for example, a "framework-as-a-service"
   platform, deployment service, or cloud offering where AbsoluteJS or a
   substantial portion of its functionality is a primary component of the value
   provided to users).

2. **Resale or Redistribution as a Standalone Product.** You may not sell,
   license, or distribute the Licensed Work, or any derivative or fork of it,
   as a standalone commercial product or framework.

3. **Removal of Attribution.** Any derivative work, fork, or redistribution of
   the Licensed Work must prominently credit AbsoluteJS and include a link to
   the original project repository (https://github.com/absolutejs/absolutejs).

For clarity, the following uses are expressly permitted:

- Using AbsoluteJS to build and deploy your own applications, websites, or
  SaaS products (whether commercial or non-commercial).
- Using AbsoluteJS as a dependency in commercial software that you build and sell,
  as long as the software is not itself a competing framework or hosting service.
- Providing consulting, development, or professional services to clients using
  AbsoluteJS.
- Forking and modifying the Licensed Work for your own internal use, provided
  attribution is maintained.

### Change Date and Change License

On the Change Date specified above, or on such other date as the Licensor may
specify by written notice, the Licensed Work will be made available under the
Change License (Apache License, Version 2.0). Until the Change Date, the terms
of this Business Source License 1.1 apply.

### Notices

You must not remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices
included in the Licensed Work.

### No Warranty

THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS". THE LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO
EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY,
